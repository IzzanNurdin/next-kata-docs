## Introduction

In [Bot studio tutorial](/tutorials/bot-studio/), we learned how to make keyword-based chatbot to order pizza. However, keyword-based chatbot is not so smart. In this tutorial we will learn how to enhance the chatbot using NL Studio.

## Creating a NL Model with NL Studio

### Login to Kata | platform

Login to Kata | Platform by entering your username and password.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-1.webp" alt="nlst-1" />
</ImageWrapper>

Click Login to continue

### Create Entity Label

After you entered to Kata Platform, click on the project you've created

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-2.webp" alt="nlst-2" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, click on NLU on the side bar

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-3.webp" alt="nlst-3" />
</ImageWrapper>

Next, click Create Entity. Entity has similar definition with NL Model. It will help us to classify every input from users.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-4.webp" alt="nlst-4" />
</ImageWrapper>

Now, create an entity called `intent` that with 4 labels: `order`, `askOptions`, `confirm` and `cancel`. Further explanation about entity is explained in [NL Studio Docs](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nlu/)

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-5.webp" alt="nlst-5" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Create Entity Type

In this entity `type`, we will create an entity with dictionary type (further explanation about entity dictionary type is explained in [NL Studio Docs](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nlu/)). This entity will handle pizza type selection. Add new entity and fill in the data as follows

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-6.webp" alt="nlst-6" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, continue filling the dictionary by adding other types

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-7.webp" alt="nlst-7" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Create Entity Size

Entity `size` is used to handle pizzas size. In this entity, we will use `Belongs to` feature which binds an entity under another entity (further explanation about belongsTo usage is explained in [NL Studio Docs](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nlu/)). We will put entity `size` under entity `type`.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-8.webp" alt="nlst-8" />
</ImageWrapper>

In dictionary section, enter a keyword as a prediction for input from users

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-9.webp" alt="nlst-9" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Create Entity Crust

Next, we will create an entity named `crust` to find out crust type on pizza. We'll put it under entity `type`.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-10.webp" alt="nlst-10" />
</ImageWrapper>

Enter the data as follows

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-11.webp" alt="nlst-11" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Create Entity Qty

In pizza chatbot which we created earlier, user must enter pizza number to purchase using regex (regular expression.)

Entity `qty` will use dictionary by entering numbers or keywords related to the number of pizzas ordered. Add entity then fill in the form as follows

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-12.webp" alt="nlst-12" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, fill in as below

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-13.webp" alt="nlst-13" />
</ImageWrapper>

After you've created entities, try to train data using your defined entities.

### Training Your Model

To start training, enter Training menu under NLU

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-14.webp" alt="nlst-14" />
</ImageWrapper>

Enter a simple phrase like "want pizza" and press "enter" on your keyboard

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-15.webp" alt="nlst-15" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, in this section you can start tagging and classifying text. Click on Add Trait, then select `intent: order`.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-16.webp" alt="nlst-16" />
</ImageWrapper>

Click Train to submit your dataset.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-17.webp" alt="nlst-17" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, add a few more sentences to train more data. You can follow this

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-18.webp" alt="nlst-18" />
</ImageWrapper>

In our next example, we will do partial tagging by entering text and doing text selection on the word we want to tag. **The process of selecting text can be done by blocking one or more words at a time using a cursor.**

You can follow the example in this following picture. On the sentence "how much american all star", select only on the word "American all star"

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-19.webp" alt="nlst-19" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, select entity `type` to classify

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-20.webp" alt="nlst-20" />
</ImageWrapper>

You can also enter a phrase "I want American all star pizza, two and bbq hand tossed one" and tag it like this

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-21.webp" alt="nlst-21" />
</ImageWrapper>

You may see a number beside an entity. That number represents how accurate an entity identifies a phrase (highest is 1.0)

Try to tag more sentences.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-22.webp" alt="nlst-22" />
</ImageWrapper>

Next, we will define parent entity using `BelongsTo`. Click on `BelongsTo` dropdown on `small` phrase, then select "Pepperoni". Final result looks like this

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-23.webp" alt="nlst-23" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Testing NLU in Prediction Console

Use Test NLU to test a dataset.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-24.webp" alt="nlst-24" />
</ImageWrapper>

Enter a word such as "i want two aas" (read: aas means American All Star). You can see the prediction result as you can see in this image

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-25.webp" alt="nlst-25" />
</ImageWrapper>

## Adjusting the Dataset

When performing NLU prediction in Test NLU, sometimes the prediction result is wrong, incomplete, or still has a low confidence score.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-26.webp" alt="nlst-26" />
</ImageWrapper>

For example, the sentence above should be tagged as `intent:order`. However, prediction result has no prediction to order. To improve or fix a prediction, enter Log menu.

### Enter Log Menu

Go to Log menu under NLU

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-27.webp" alt="nlst-27" />
</ImageWrapper>

On this page, you will see previous dataset when you have predicted on Test NLU.

### Fix The Prediction

We will adjust the dataset. Click on pencil icon (which placed in left icon)

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-28.webp" alt="nlst-28" />
</ImageWrapper>

Then, select `intent:order`.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-29.webp" alt="nlst-29" />
</ImageWrapper>

Click train to revise the prediction. Trained data will be seen as follow.

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-30.webp" alt="nlst-30" />
</ImageWrapper>

You will receive a notification after you click “Train”

### Test NLU with data that has been fixed

We will try to predict another dataset and see if the result has been improved. Click Test NLU and enter a phrase "hi, do you sell aas".

<ImageWrapper>
  <NextImage src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-31.webp" alt="nlst-31" />
</ImageWrapper>

Congratulations, now you have learned how to train entity in NL Studio.
