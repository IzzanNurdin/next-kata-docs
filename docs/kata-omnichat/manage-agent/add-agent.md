When you are in step 3, you need to enter the agent information as shown below:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field Name</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Agent Name
   </td>
   <td>Enter the name of your agent or additional admin. For example Katherine Wong
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Role
   </td>
   <td>The role of the person you invited to.  You can choose the person that you assign as an agent or administrator
<p>
<strong>If Agent</strong>, Agents with this role can only access inboxes, reports, and conversations. They can assign conversations to other agents or themselves and resolve conversations
</p>
<strong>If Administrator</strong>, Administrator will have access to all Kata Omnichat features enabled for your account, including settings, along with all of a normal agents' privileges
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Email Address
   </td>
   <td>Add the Email address of the person youâ€™ve invited to join
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

When adding agents and administrators, there are 2 status:

1. **Pending Verification** that means the email invitation has been sent to the invited one. Action is needed from the invited agent or administrator to confirm the invitation
2. **Verified** that means the invited agent and administrator has confirmed the invitation, then they can explore the dashboard
