**Configure your profile**

Kata Omnichat allows both admin and agents to _set up your profile_ by changing display picture, name, and changing password. It is easier to identify an account in the team.

To set up your profile, you can follow these steps:

1. Login to your account
2. Click on **_3 kebab menu icons_** in the left under the corner of your dashboard, besides your name
3. Click **Profile Setting**
4. You will be directed to the page where you can set up your profile
