As an agent, you will see the conversations that were assigned to you, both manual assignment or auto-assignment. In the conversation box, you will see 2 options in tab: Mine and Unassigned. Learn more about these below:

1.  Unassigned: The first incoming message that is not assigned to you. This will help the agent to identify which conversation is not awarded by agents
2.  Mine: The incoming conversation that has already been assigned to me. This will help the admin to identify which chat needs to handle ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jv5ORrfZTw9gWtF9DdENnyhhNjKsqIpuyKoUcGe0tuQh5Dalm9BN8h3vzgLoLfMm-ueglGWXaqOJdmtbxassKxqhr4RgXDwQOfRG4sAjxxQh8VsqI9vaSg21tMIfkxUktEWWJW76)
