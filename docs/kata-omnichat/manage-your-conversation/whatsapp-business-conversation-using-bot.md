For the WABA API channel, we can use the bot as our agent. Learn about how the bot can start the conversation:

1.  The customer started to chat to users’ WABA number
2.  During chatbot and customer conversation, customers can request handover to agents or agents can take over the conversation if users add an “agent bot” in the inbox. Learn more about [setup agent bot in Omnichat](/kata-omnichat/configure-your-agent-chatbot/setup-agent-bot-in-kata-omnichat)

3.  Customers can send and receive messages until agents resolve the conversation (if they choose to be handover) and the conversation will be handed off again to the agent bot or end the conversation with a chatbot
