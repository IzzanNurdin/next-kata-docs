As an admin or agent, you can see the conversation handled by the bot. In this case, if you see the bot not solving the problem, you can use the Take over the bot. You can see the bot here:

1. Go to the **Conversation** menu to see all your messages, both new and past messages
2. Choose **Bot**
3. To take over the conversation, click the **Open** button which is placed next in the agents list dropdown
