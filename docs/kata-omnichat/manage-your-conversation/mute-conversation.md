In Kata Omnichat, both admin and agents can manage the conversation to mute the conversation. The mute conversation is the feature when you canâ€™t see the conversation for 6 hours.

To set up this feature, you can go to conversation, then click the kebab icon in the upper right corner, then choose mute conversation.
