Every conversation in Omnichat can have an assignee. An assignee can be manually added to the conversation or the organizations can opt for a round-robin assignment system. A conversation can be manually assigned to 2 categories of users.

1.  Agents who have access to the inbox in which the conversation is created
2.  Administrators who can access every conversation in the system

To assign an agent or admin to a conversation, an admin/agent can select the assignee from the dropdown named under "Assigned Agent" from the "Conversation Details" section in the right sidebar, as shown below.
