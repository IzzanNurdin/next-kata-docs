The private note is the feature for the admin and agent to communicate with each other based on the conversation. The private note always sticks  in the conversation box. Go to the conversation, then click the Private Note tap in the upper of the conversation box. Then write some notes about the conversation then add notes.

Private notes will be included in the conversation but only admin and agent can see it, customers can’t see the notes.
