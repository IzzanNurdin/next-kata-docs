## Using private notes in conversations

The private note is the feature for the admin and agent to communicate with each other based on the conversation. The private note always sticks  in the conversation box. Go to the conversation, then click the Private Note tap in the upper of the conversation box. Then write some notes about the conversation then add notes.

Private notes will be included in the conversation but only admin and agent can see it, customers can’t see the notes.

## Manual Agent Assignment

Every conversation in Omnichat can have an assignee. An assignee can be manually added to the conversation or the organizations can opt for a round-robin assignment system. A conversation can be manually assigned to 2 categories of users.

1.  Agents who have access to the inbox in which the conversation is created
2.  Administrators who can access every conversation in the system

To assign an agent or admin to a conversation, an admin/agent can select the assignee from the dropdown named under "Assigned Agent" from the "Conversation Details" section in the right sidebar, as shown below.

Besides that, as an agent you can assign conversation to another agent or administration by following the same steps above.

## Auto agent assignment

Omnichat provides a round-robin auto-assignment system for conversations. The assignment follows the logic mentioned below.

Note: Round robin assignment is enabled by default.

1.  If there are agents online who have access to the inbox in which a conversation is created, the system would distribute the conversations equally among the online agents
2.  If all the agents are offline, the system would distribute the conversations equally to all agents
