Canned Responses are saved reply templates that can be used to quickly send out a reply to a conversation. Both Agent and Administrator can add canned responses. To add a canned response, you need to follow these steps.

1. Go to Omnichat **Homepage**
2. Click **Setting > Canned Responses** on the sidebar. Canned responses are used with the help of Short Codes. Agents or admin can access canned responses while on a chat by typing '/' followed by the shortcode.
