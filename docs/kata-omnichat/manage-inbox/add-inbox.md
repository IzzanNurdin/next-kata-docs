**In this step**, after you found the first step to add or create an inbox, you need to authenticate your account based on the selected channel. Learn more about connecting with Instagram Direct messages [here](/kata-omnichat/before-you-start/prepare-your-instagram-business-account) and Whatsapp Business API [here](/kata-omnichat/before-you-start/prepare-your-waba-account).
