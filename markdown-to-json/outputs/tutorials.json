      "contents": "Introduction Building a chatbot on Kata Platform is quick and easy even with a lack of programming knowledge In this tutorial we will learn how to create a simple bot on LINE Messenger to order a pizza We will also learn how to train your bot with NL Studio Lets start by looking at this bot diagram or commonly called conversation tree Conversation tree is an overview of chatbot functionalities In this conversation tree we break down the process of ordering pizza and the types of bot action we want to use on each state Sign up to Kata Platform Create an account on Kata Platform to start building chatbot On your browser open and click Sign Up Then fill the form with a username an email and an account type Continue by clicking Sign Up You will get a confirmation email once our team has verified your account You may follow the instructions provided in the confirmation email to activate and start using your account Create a Project Login to Kata Platform On your browser open platformkataailogin and enter your username amp password Click Login to continue Create a project After you logged in you will be taken to the Project Page Click on Create Project and fill in the form Each project contains one bot design one NL and one CMS NLU language is used to determine which language model you want to use Currently we support Bahasa Indonesia and English You can also choose NLU Visibility to be public or private If you choose public all Kata Platform users can utilize your NLU using root and inherit function Create Fallback Flow Create fallback flow Once you create a project you will be redirected to the Bot Studio menu Now we are going to learn how to create a flow Flow is a container of intent state and action A flow typically represents a linear process The first flow that we will create is a Fallback Flow Its purpose is to handle undefined users input or commonly called else condition state In this case the else condition is everything that is not Start Order You may find a flow that is created automatically by the system or default flow We will delete that flow by pressing more button and then Delete Next click Create Flow button to create fallback flow Set flow to active persistent and default Create fallback intent After you have created fallback flow we will create new intent by pressing the Intents tab on the submenu Then we will create a new intent for fallback flow Click Create Intent button to create Then fill in the form as follows Create State init Next we will create a state called init Click the button at the bottom right of your screen Fill state with name init on Overview tab and set it to initial state and end state as shown below Enabling Initial State and End State will make init the first and the last flow to be checked by the bot when there isnt any flow that matches a users input Now we will create a bot response to display an apology message Click Add actions button to create a response Container for creating action will appear Create Action Text in State init Click on button to create a new action Choose action type Text Then fill in the form Click on Create Action button Create Self Transition in State Init The last step to finalize fallback flow is to create selftransition for init state Self transition is required to avoid error when the next state is not available Click on Transitions and enable Self Transition Click Create button Your screen should look like this Create Order Flow Next we will create Start Order flow to handle pizza order Create Flow Order First step is to create another flow called order Created flow will be shown like this Create Keyword NLUs for Order In this step we will define the NLU Natural Language Understanding to trigger order flow NLU is used to translate user inputs into data that machine can understand There are many types of NLU but the type that we will use in this particular flow is called keyword To define the NLU go to NLUs menu Next click on Create NLU Choose Keyword type and enter keywords that represents order such as order pls order order pza Successfully created NLU looks like this Create Intent for Order Each flow requires an intent to classify users inquiry and trigger matching flow So our next step is to set initial intent for order flow Go back to Conversation Flow menu and click on order flow then click on Intents tab Previously you already created keyword NLUs called order We will set that keyword as intent in order flow Map the NLU on classifier section Click Create to create the intent Your screen should look like this Create a State Named init Every flow must have at least one state Because we havent created any state in order flow we have to create one Lets create a state called init Click Create button to create initial state Next we will define how the bot will respond to user who entered order flow Create Action for Pizza Menu As seen on the conversation tree below the first message in order flow is Show Pizza Type Create a State to Show Pizza type in Text Action Type To get started we need to create a state named showPizza on order flow Click on button in Conversation Flow menu Lets begin by creating an action called pizzaOptions This action will inform users in text about our available pizza menu Click on button to create an action and choose Text as action type Fill in Text action type to inform our pizza menu Click on Create Action to finalize Next step is to create an action called askOptions Click on Create Action button Your form should look like this Then you have to make selftransition in Transition tab as follow Click Create to create the state Successfully created state will look like this Update showPizza state Into Show Pizza Menu in Carousel Action Type Previous step is an example to create action to show pizza menu in text Lets try to update the state into Carousel action type To update the state click on showPizza state and an update state form will appear Then remove all actions in the state by clicking x on each action After removing available actions we will create an action called pizzaMenu as Carousel action type Click on Add actions button then click on button to create a new action Choose Carousel action type to continue Enter pizzaMenu as name Fill in the carousel content by clicking Add carousel button then click on Add action button to define the label and type Next click on Add Payload button to enter key and value Fill in first carousel with this data Title Pepperoni Text This is the favorite of Peps Thumbnail Image Url Actions Label Pepperoni Type Postback Payload key type value pizza key pizza value PepperoniFill in second carousel with this data Title Veggie Lovers Text Vegie vegie stay healthy Thumbnail Image Url Actions Label Veggie Lovers Type Postback Payload key type value pizza key pizza value Veggie LoversYour first form should look like this Your second form should look like this Finalize this step by clicking Create Action It should look like this Once the bot displays a carousel containing the type for pizza menu its next step is to ask user to select the pizza Click Add actions button to trigger dropdown list then choose askOptions After you select askOptions action click Create Action button to finalize this step Your form should look like this Click Update to update the state Create Intent to Choose A Pizza Now we have to create an intent called pizzaChosen to handle users input after they have selected a pizza type Click on Intent menu in order flow Click on Create Intent and create intent as follow Successfully created intent looks like this Create Transition between init and showPizza Now we will create a transition between two states that we have created before Click the green dot on init state and a connector line will appear Connect that line to showPizza state If you do it right a Create Transition form will appear Fill in the form with these data and click Create Create reenter intent Next we will add reenter intent so the bot can return to its previous state after triggering fallback state Create the intent in order flow Create Action for Asking Pizza Quantity In this step we will learn how to create Ask quantity state Create pizzaQuantity state In this step we will create pizzaQuantity state to handle order quantity The type of action we will use is in this state is Text Click on button on order flow and fill the form as follows Then you have to make selftransition in Transition tab as follow Result Create NLUs quantity Afterwards we have to handle users input with NLUs Because we only allowed number from 1 to 9 we will create a limitation in regex format Click on Create NLUs and follow this screenshot Successfully created NLU will be shown like this Create Intent quantity After we created the NLU we will add an intent to respond users input In order flow click on Create Intent and fill in the form Successfully created intent will look like this Create Transition between showPizza and pizzaQuantity Now we have to create a transition between showPizzaand pizzaQuantity We will also store payloadpizza value into contextpizza Click on the blue dot on showPizza and drag the line to pizzaQuantity state to create the transition Create Transition form will appear after you have successfully connected the states Created transition will look like this Create Confirmation Action Our next step is creating Ask confirmation state Create YESNO keyword NLUs First we will create a keyword NLU to handle yes and no Click on Create NLUs and fill in as follows Successfully created NLU will look like this Create confirmPizza state Now we will create confirmPizza state to handle order confirmation We will also store chosen pizza amp quantity information in this state Select order flow and click on button to create confirmPizza state Add mapping in onTransit tab Dont forget to add selftransition in a state Click Create Action Your

pizzaQuantity and drag the line to confirmPizza state to create a transition Create Transition form will appear after you successfully connected the states Result will be shown as follows Create intent yesno Previously we already made an NLU containing yes and no keywords We will use that NLU as a classifier on an intent First of all we will create an intent in order flow for the keyword yes Then we will create an intent for keyword no Both intent will appear as follows Create done state In done state we will complete the order by saying thank you and end the conversation We will also set a condition when a user wants to cancel the order So in this state we will create two actions sayThanks and sayCancel Also dont forget to add self transition in the state Result Create a transition from confirmPizza to done Next we will connect confirmPizza state to done state Because done is the last state we will set it as default transition Connect confirmPizza to done by clicking the blue dot and drag the line to connect the states Create Transition form will appear after you have successfully connected the states Final flow Publish Your Bot To save your work click on Publish button
