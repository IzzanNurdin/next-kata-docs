instead they will be charged per conversation See how it works below for more information Terms amp Definitions Conversation A session that occurs between businesses and users within 1x24 hours Conversation via WhatsApp can be initiated by both businesses and users UserInitiated Conversation A conversation initiated by a user to a business This session starts when the business responds to the first message from a customer within 1x24 hours either using an automated chatbot or an agent manually via the omnichannel dashboard If the business replies to messages more than 1x24 hours from the users first message then the session will be considered a Business Initiated Conversation BusinessInitiated Conversation A conversation initiated by a business to a user usually in the form of a notification template message formerly known as a Template Message or a message used to follow up on a UserInitiated Conversation that has lasted more than 1x24 hours This session will be open for 1x24 hours starting from the first message sent by the business and in that session the business is only charged for one session even if it sends more than one message template Kata Business Dashboard Product of Kataai for WhatsApp Business Platform management formerly called WhatsApp Business APIWABA Businesses can register purchase credit independently as well as perform uses such as number verification submission and sending of template messages and monitoring usage of purchased credits Credit Represents the right to a number of conversations that are paid in advance in the form of pulses in the amount of Rupiah currency which can be reduced by the unit price of UserInitiated Conversations andor BusinessInitiated Conversations TopUp Credit a system of adding credit in bulk or wholesale paid in advance TopUp Pricing Tier Fee structuring system for topup credit where purchases with a larger value will get a bigger discount How It Works WhatsApp Business API conversations fall into two different priced categories Userinitiated such as customer service and general inquiries Inbound Businessinitiated such as notifications and notifications Outbound All conversations or Conversations are measured in 24hour increments also known as Sessions which start each time the first message is delivered by the business The first message can be a response to a user question or a businessinitiated message template that is being delivered Charges for conversations are based on the end users phone number Rates for businessinitiated and userinitiated conversations vary by market country or region See Rates for specific pricing information The first 1000 conversations each month will be free so your business can start building experiences your customers will love before they have to pay In addition conversations will not be charged when a user sends a message to a business using the calltoaction button on an Ad that clicks into WhatsApp or a Facebook Page CTA Scenarios Disclaimer This scenario is based on The Official Facebook documentation The complete scenario can be found here For the following scenarios we will use a user named Anne Budianto a Commercial Air airline customer and Kicks an online shoe retailer Anne prefers to use WhatsApp to message businesses as it is the fastest way to get the support and information she needs Commercial Air and Kicks know that many of their customers prefer to connect via WhatsApp so they are ready to answer questions or send important updates via message 1 UserInitiated Conversation UIC 1a Illustrated Scenario 1 Scenario 1 Usercustomer service or general support questions in one 24hour conversation session Our user Anne Budianto messaged Commercial Air with a question about an upcoming reservation When a Commercial Air reply message is sent a 24hour conversation session will start In this scenario all additional messages are free within a 24hour session This encourages Commercial Air to follow up with support questions in a timely manner while giving users the ability to exchange as many messages as needed to resolve issues in a 24hour session If Commercial Air continues to exchange messages with Anne after the initial 24hour conversation session has ended they will be charged for the new conversation They will also be asked to send a message template to start a new conversation if it has been more than 24 hours since Annes last message which will be charged as a businessinitiated conversation In this scenario Anne gets the info she needs about her reservation and Commercial Air pays for a single userinitiated conversation Cost IDR 320 for 1 UIC 1b Illustrated Scenario 2 Scenario 2 A usercustomerinitiated conversation that leads to two conversations with a Message Template Anne wanted to check on an order she had made with Kicks an online shoe retailer He did it at 1313 Kicks have a bot set up to reply to basic order inquiries and respond to Anne with delivery details at 1313 As a followup the next day the Kicks bot notified Anne that her order had shipped at 345 pm In this scenario Kicks pays for one userinitiated conversation and one businessinitiated conversation Cost IDR 820 for 1 UIC amp 1 BIC 2 BusinessInitiated Conversation UIC 2a Illustrated Scenario 3 Scenario 3 Business initiates sending notification messages using Message Templates When a flight is delayed or its status changes Commercial Air notifies customers who have chosen to receive notifications using message templates Two message templates sent in one 24hour conversation session result in one businessinitiated conversation fee In this scenario Commercial Air wants to inform Anne that her flight is delayed by 30 minutes Commercial Air will charge for one businessinitiated conversation for sending these two message templates to Anne in a 24hour conversation session Cost IDR 500 for 1 BIC 2b Illustrated Scenario 4 Scenario 4 The business initiates a conversation that leads to a twoway conversation with the usercustomer When a customer places a new order from Kicks the online retailer sends a text message to confirm the order has been received and asks the customer if they would like to receive a notification when the order is shipped The customer selects Yes and chooses to receive additional order notifications In this scenario Kicks pays for one conversation initiated by the business If the user replies more than 24 hours after sending the initial business message and is followed by a business reply it will result in a new conversation initiated by the user Cost a IDR 500 for 1 BIC if the user does not reply to the message b IDR 500 for 1 BIC if the user replies within 1x24 hours c IDR 820 for 1 BIC amp 1 UIC if the user replies after 1x24 hours These are four common conversation scenarios between businesses and users If you still have questions regarding the comparison of the scenarios above not limited to other possibilities that can occur between business and user conversations please contact the Kataai team to discuss it further Pricing The pricing scheme continues to use the credit system with a topup in bulk Imagine buying a prepaid cell phone number that will be reduced by BusinessInitiated Conversation andor UserInitiated Conversation according to the number of conversations initiated by businesses and users Dont worry because no major changes have occurred We only convert credit purchases that previously used the number of messages to be sent into Rupiah currency values that can be used for the existing types of conversations The tiering system still applies the more credits you buy the bigger the discount you get To accommodate changes in pricing schemes that occur said the Business Dashboard to be updated to make it easier to use and monitor credit and the amount of usage The latest update will be released on February 1 2022 along with the price changes of the WhatsApp Business API 1 IDR for Indonesian Numbers

Figure 3 Dashboard project Fill in project detail then click Create Project After the project has been created you will be redirected to the Conversation Flow page to create flow state and action Congratulations you successfully created a new project Create a Flow Flow is a conversation chatbot flow In this simple tutorial you will create 1 flow and use 1 default flow Default flow is a fallback flow or a flow to answer if questions are not understandable by a chatbot In the Conversation Flow click the Create Flow Fill in the flow name hello then click Create If a flow is successfully created it will show in the Conversation Flows sidebar Figure 4 New flow name hello Create a State The state is a step in a conversation A flow must have 1 state called the initial state and 1 state called the end state In this tutorial you will create 2 states in the flow hello which are init state and hello state Init state will become the initial state and the hello state becomes the end state Click the icon in the Conversation Flow menu Figure 5 Button to create a new state In this step you will create an initial state Fill in the init state then turn on the toggle Initial State to set it as the initial state Figure 6 Create a state name init Next create a hello state This state will be an end state so you must turn on the End State toggle Do a similar step with the second step In this step you will get an error that an end state must have at least 1 action So the next step is to create an action in the hello state Create an Action Action is a bot response in text images buttons interactive messages such as a carousel in LINE a generic template in FB Messenger and others A state must have at least 1 action except in the initial state This tutorial will create a text action in the hello state Click in the hello state then it will show a form on the right screen To create a new action click on the Add action button Figure 7 Add new action Click on the icon Next it will show various available actions Choose action Text Figure 8 Input new action Figure 9 Input Text action After choosing a Text action it will show an interface like in the image below Input action name then click Add Variant button to input text response Figure 10 Input text response in bot Finishing your action by clicking the Create Action button Then finalize the state by clicking the Create button Create an Intent A chatbot needs to understand endusers input to show correct action or bot response The intent will recognize input in the Kata Platform by checking keywords NL or regex Enduser is a term for chatbot users This step will create an intent to catch when endusers greet the chatbot In the hello flow choose the Intent menu Next click Create Intent Figure 11 The page to create a new intent Input intent detail with name helloIntent Then turn on toggle As Initial to create a trigger in the chatbot and execute the hello flow Next continue to choose the Text type Input a condition to make the chatbot execute the intent when the enduser sends the message Hello or start content Hello content start Click the Create button to finish creating intent Figure 12 Create helloIntent to recognize greetings from endusers Create a Transition Transition is a procedure to move from one state to another state if a condition is fulfilled Create transition by pulling a line from the source state to the destination state like the image below Figure 13 Transition between states In this step you will create a transition between the init state and the hello state by pulling a line If you succeed to create a transition it will show a form on the right screen Then input condition detail to create transition can be executed if an enduser input is caught by helloIntent intent intent helloIntent Click the Save button to finish creating the transition Publish Bot This publish feature is useful to save changes in the form of revision numbers The Publish

and build their NLU capability for their conversational AI product How to Use This guide will teach you how to integrate NLU into your chatbot to recognize specific endusers input Before you start you will need to create at least one entity To create an entity go to the NLU menu Then click the Entity menu Figure 1 NLU and entity menu Click Create Entity to set up a new entity It will show a form on the right screen Fill in the entity name Inherit lets you copy an entity from any public NLU on the Kata Platform To inherit an NLU type the NLU ID with usernameproject name Inherited entities will sync to the original entity including the labels and training data For example in the getting started chatbot section your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkatatest_simple_bot Type is intended for the entity type We have 3 entity types in the Kata Platform Trait is a text classifier to classify a sentence into a particular labels This type is suitable for making your bot recognize nuance in a sentence Dictionary is a word tagger which has keys and labels It will form an array The Phrase is a word tagger Figure 2 Entity type dictionary The Profile is an AI model that is available to use by users Depending on data training and your dataset you can choose any profiles you want The default profile is suitable for many data samples so that this profile is available in all entity types intent profile is suitable for entity type trait default_v2 profile is our newest profile and is suitable if you have a large amount of data Root enables you to create an entity using other users NLU to copy the training data and add new labels Therefore it is suitable if you have a trained NLU and want to add more labels in the NLU You can type an NLU ID which consists of username and project with format usernameproject name Labels are a feature to determine classes or categories from an entity To add a new label you can type and press enter on your keyboard If you choose entity type dictionary it will show a dropdown name Belongs to This feature enables you to define relationships between entities Belongs to feature can only be used for entities in the same NLU with entity type phrase or dictionary It is suitable if your data sample is like this Saya mau beli es kopi susu 2 dan less sugarEs kopi susu is the main menu 2 and less sugar are modifiers to detailing the order So in Belongs To concept you will tag 2 and choose belongsTo Training your NLU After creating an entity and labels you have to train them Go to NLU gt Training menu Figure 3 Training model position Then you will see 2 choices to train your entities Single training is a way to train sentences training data one by one Bulk training is a way to train up to 200 sentences training data by uploading a txt file with annotations inside the file These are steps to train your NLU using single training For example to train 1 sentence for your NLU type a sentence then press enter on the keyboard to review the training For example Saya ingin membeli kopi susu Figure 4 Training box Next you can preview the sentence first and tag your entities You can block or double click in a word to tag a word Then it will show a dropdown to choose entities and labels in format entity namelabel name You can select a dropdown at the bottom of the entities list for tagging a sentence Figure 5 Tag a word using an entity type dictionary or phrase Figure 6 Tag a sentence using entity type trait Click the Train button to submit training data These are steps to train your NLU using bulk training First open your text and source code editor Notepad notepad sublime Create a new file You will create training data using a simple syntax for entity type trait and for entity type phrase Example for entity type trait Saya mau pesan pizza intentorder It means the sentence is classified into an entity named intent with the label order Example for entity type phrase and dictionary Saya mau pesan tiket ke destination Malang atas nama nerperson Budi intentorder It means the word Malang is tagged for entity name destination and Budi is tagged for entity name ner with label person Save the following training data into trainingdataexampletxt Go to NLU gt Training in Platform Then click on the Bulk Training button Click on the Browse button to open the file explorerfinder or drag and drop the file into the browse file dialog Wait for the upload process After the upload is complete you can review the training data file in the Platform Figure 7 Review training data Click on the Train button to train the data You will see a customer satisfaction survey after using the feature Fill in the survey then click X to close the dialog You have successfully trained your NLU with the uploaded data Figure 8 Successfully trained Every training will make your NLU smarter measured by a confidence score The confidence score is how the NLU recognizes endusers input between 0 and 1 Test Your NLU You can test if your NLU is good enough or wrong in the Kata Platform by using the Test NLU feature These are the steps Click the Test NLU button on the right bottom of your screen Figure 9 Test NLU location Then it will show a chat window Type in the chatbox a sentence to test your NLU The best practice is to prepare data training and data testing separately but they must have similarities When you enter a sentence or data testing a result is shown For example here is how to read the result from the test NLU example id abf78 input halo output kata product Intent type trait value bayar start 0 end 4 score 08116588592529297 label bayar Lets break them down It is a sentence or word that you typed input halo Two entities are not detected by your input halo so that the results are null output kata product There is a detected entity called Intent and the entity type is trait Then start and end mean character count from hello Next score means a confidence score from the NL model to predict the sentence or word from endusers Lastly the label labels under the entity that the word or sentence detected Intent type trait value bayar start 0 end 4 score 08116588592529297 label bayar Finally you understand the basics of creating NLU and how to train it Now lets improve your knowledge by following our advanced guidelines to design NLU and training it Advanced guidelines to design and train your NLU Designing NLU You can create NLU depending on your needs The more complex an NLU the larger training data is required to build it A few things you must consider when designing an NLU are The total number of labels in an entity NLU complexity impacts training process complexity as well The total number of entities in an NLU An entity will have its model so the more entities you owned then the longer the training process In the next part you will learn several suggestions to reduce complexity and make the training process easier First suggestion Dividing entity type trait into a few entities If an entity has too many labels eg 50 labels it will require at least 50 training data Moreover you will need larger training data to reach a high prediction result score if sentences between labels are alike To help this problem you can break down labels from an entity into a few entities For example you have an entity type intent as follows NLU name nl1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels lupa_pin ganti_pin kartu_hilang buku_tabungan_hilang ganti_kartu ganti_buku_tabungan buat_kartu cara_daftar_nasabah You can break down it into 2 differents entities as follows NLU name nl2 First entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels lupa ganti ganti buat hilang Second Entity Entity name topic Entity type trait Entity profile topic Labels pin kartu buku_tabungan nasabah This method can increase your model prediction score by dividing the score into several groups of labels From the example above the first NLU nl1 will divide the prediction score 100 into 8 different labels for the intent entity Otherwise the second NLU nl2 will divide the prediction score 100 into 4 labels for the intent entity and 4 labels for the topic entity Important note This suggestion is recommended if you have limited training data If you have a large amount of training data or there are no problems with your current training data this suggestion is unnecessary Second suggestion Utilize profile intent Another tip is to use an intent profile which is influenced by predictions from other models type phrase or type dictionary This way can make the training process if training data is limited and sentences form alike Important note This suggestion applies to entity type trait with intent profile only First example given a training data dimana tempat perpanjang sim paling dekat ask_nearby_simstnk dimana tempat perpanjang stnk sekitar sini ask_nearby_simstnk dimana kantor polisi terdekat ask_nearby_polisiAnd you have an NLU with the detail as follows NLU name nlv1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_nearby_simstnk ask_nearby_polisi This NLU can be changed into NLU name nlv2 First entity Entity name simstnk Entity type dict Entity profile default Key sim Labels sim surat izin mengemudi Key stnk Labels stnk surat tanda kendaraan bermotor Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_nearby_simstnk ask_nearby_polisi NLU nlv2 will make the training process faster because the words sim and stnk are in one similar category which is simstnk However there is a case that you need to be aware of An intent profile can remove the detailed information Here is an example The second example given training data resep untuk membuat pizza bbq apa ya ask_bbq_recipe pizza pepperoni gimana cara buatnya ya ask_pepperoni_recipe kasih tau dong resep pizza aas buatanmu ask_aas_recipeThen you will have an NLU NLU name nlv1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_bbq_recipe ask_pepperoni_recipe ask_aas_recipe Next you change the NLU structure into this NLU name nlv2 First entity Entity name pizza Entity type dict Entity profile default Key bbq Labels bbq barbeque Key pepperoni Labels pepperoni peperoni Key aas Labels aas american all star Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_bbq_recipe ask_pepperoni_recipe ask_aas_recipe The intent entity in nluv1 can recognize the differentiation between labels Otherwise nlv2 cannot acknowledge it because bbq pepperoni and aas are set up as one category pizza If users input a sentence resep buat bbq apa ya the score will show the same results from all labels If you still want to use dictionary type for this second example you can try this way NLU name nlv3 First entity Entity name pizza Entity type dict Entity profile default Key bbq Labels bbq barbeque Key pepperoni Labels pepperoni peperoni Key aas Labels aas american all star Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_pizza_recipe The nlv3 can recognize a sentence has ask_pizza_recipe intent and can specify which pizza by using pizza entity This method is helpful to make your bot easy to understand limited words such as product names Otherwise this suggestion is not recommended if youre using generic words Third suggestion Dividing NLU A bot can have multiple NLU Here are a few cases in which NLU can be divided Use specific NLU for certain flows Some flows in a bot may have a particular NLU for a flow which means input to trigger the flow is different from other flows This way can reduce the number of listed labels in an entity and ease the prediction process Examples Using credential NLU which is executed when the user first interacts with the bot Using order NLU in commerce bot will be executed when the user chooses the order menu Use specific NLU for certain states Few states in a bot may have similar input but have different meanings depending on what states are running You can configure the NLU in state condition Examples YesNo NLU can be used in overall flows but shall be specified in states that require endusers confirmation Note You can use these methods if you have too many labels data between labels are alike a limited number of training data predictions result is not optimal yet or found other problems But if your NLU is fine you can create an entity with many labels Training Guideline The training process is required to make a bot response to endusers messages and requires training data In NLU a training process will also train all models read entities For example NLUA has entity1 entity2 and entity3 Because each entity owns its models NLUA has 3 models that run individually If you input training data for NLUA you train entity1 entity2 and entity3 models Here are suggestions that you need to consider in the training process Add various forms of language Input training data with various forms such as formal informal slang long or short sentences If you only train a form eg formal then the model may understand formal sentences Avoid imbalanced data between labels The imbalanced data affect bias between labels A small amount of imbalanced data is not a problem However if you have a large amount of imbalanced data the predictions result too significant on specific labels and a bias Add countertraining Countertraining means you input training data that is not classified to current labels For example 0You have an entity that can predict book genres into 3 categories read labels horror fiction and biography Each label has been trained and can recognize each genre Then an input is entered with a new category named history Because the model only distinguishes between the 3 labels and assumes that each book must be categorized into 3 labels the model cannot answer not all three or none To make the model understand history input you have to enter training data without giving any intenttags Add a new label to the trained entity If you want to add a new label train the label with a similar total amount of training with current labels For example You have an entity with 5 labels Each label has 10 training data Then you add a new label Your next step will be to train the label equal to or more than 10 training data The final step is to train the other 5 labels with a few training data Ambiguous data Avoid preparing ambiguous training data into different labels Ambiguous data means you input the same training data but the context depends on what endusers asked For example Enduser sends the word sudah if your bot asks a question about apakah sudah makan Smalltalk flow or apakah sudah menikah Credential flow Both sentences can be recognized as intentdoneEating read entity intent with label doneEating or intentmarried read entity intent with label married To reduce this ambiguity case you shall prepare training data as follows Input training data such as sudah menikah in intent married There is an additional word menikah that could distinguish the labels For the word sudah train it to a different label such as intentdone For the bot implementation you shall put a condition intent done for states executed when endusers said sudah word Relationship between bot NL and training process Bot development used NL in bot and training process is influencing each other Bot implementation can process some limitations encountered in NL results through the bot NL complexity is affected by bot complexity So the more complex a bot the more complex the NL will be and the more training data For NL it is possible to mispredict a few data It is a usual case You can solve this by adding training data or postprocessing in the bot This is the end of the guidance You can contact supportkataai if you have any difficulties when implementing this ",

      "contents": "What is Bulk Training Great NL models are a fundamental part of making a great chatbot and approximately 70 of all chatbot projects use NL models instead of a keywordbased approach based on our Kataai projects data Previously the bulk training process was very technical because developers needed to use KataCLI and view the results on the Platform GUI This back and forth switching of tools was required to do training Now you can use the new Bulk Training on the Platform GUI itself to train more than 200 sentencestraining data at once These are the screenshots of our newest feature Figure 1 Upload training data file Figure 2 Preview from uploaded training data from file You can click on this video tutorial or go to the NLU gt Training menu check the screenshot below Figure 3 Video tutorial in bulk training Why Do We Need This Feature Training NL models is one of the most timeconsuming processes in chatbot development which could take approximately 6 weeks On average a complex chatbot project requires 1000 data for their NL models Its not ideal to train the sentences one by one as a typical 1000sentence NL model would easily take more than 4 hours to train Hence bulk training can significantly reduce the training effort with a simplified user flow How to Use Bulk Training Create a Project Mission Create a new project Prerequisite You already have a Platform account and have logged in Click on the Create Project button Fill in the required fields for the project Click Create Project Create Entities And Labels With Type trait Mission Create NL models to be trained and type entity trait Learn more about entity type trait Prerequisites You already have a project Go to NLU Click on Entities Click the Create Entity button to start creating entities and labels Learn more about entities and labels or you may want to explore how to design the NLU Fill in fields with this example Entity name intent Type trait Profile default Text classification To create labels you need to type and press enter to save a new label Fill in with these examples Labels greetings thank you The result goes here Figure 4 Create entity type trait Click Create to create a new entity with greetings and thank you labels Create Entities And Labels With Type phrase Mission Create NL models to be trained and type entity phrase Learn more about entity type trait Prerequisites You already have a project Click the Create Entity button to start creating entities and labels Learn more about entities and labels or you may want to explore how to design the NLU Fill in fields with these examples Entity name object Type phrase Profile default Default phrase To create labels you need to type and press enter to save a new pile Fill in with this example Labels person The result goes here Figure 5 Create entity type phrase Guideline to Create a Training Data Before we use the NL bulk training we will create training data using a simple syntax for entity type trait and for entity type phrase Learn more about entity type trait and entity type phrase This syntax is only allowed for entity type trait Saya mau pesan pizza intentorderThis means that the sentence is classified into entity name intent with label order Totalnya berapa ya intentask questionTypehow_muchThis means that the sentence is classified into entity name intent with label order and entity name questionType with label how_much This syntax is only allowed for entity type phrase Saya mau pesan tiket ke destination Malang atas nama nerperson Budi intentorderThis means that the word Malang is tagged for entity name destination and Budi is tagged for entity name ner with label person Create New Training Data Mission Create new training data in a txt extension file In this step you will need to open a text and source code editor such as Notepad in Windows notepad Sublime etc Prerequisites You already have a project and entities Open your text and source code editor Notepad notepad sublime etc Create a new file Type following sentences example to create training data to train our NL models You can add up to 200 sentencestraining data Or you can download this

attribute features You can add more than 1 NLUs Then it enables the intent to check all NLUs Then NLUs will check the threshold The threshold can act as a confidence level and these values range from 00 completely uncertain to 10 completely confident This confidence level is usually set between 07 to 08 Finally NLUs will check whether the confidence score from the incoming message is lower or higher than the threshold If an incoming message is lower than the threshold NLUs will send bot information that the incoming message is incorrect with what NLU had recognized Then the intent will be checked by other NLUs If an incoming message is equal to or higher than the threshold NLUs will send information that the condition is correct If NLUs condition has matched then intent will send information to a bot that incoming message from the enduser is recognized as intent yesNL for example Then the bot will check the following action if an intent condition has been fulfilled For example if the transition has condition intentyesNL then the bot will execute the next state connected between the transition Check the image below for more detail Figure 1 Transition example which condition has intent using NLU How to Use To integrate NLU can be implemented in chatbot these are the steps First in the Kata Platform go to the Flow menu Then click the NLUs menu in the sidebar Figure 2 NLUs

dropdown you will search your NLU to integrate it into your chatbot NLU ID consists of username and project with format usernameproject name For example in the getting started chatbot section your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkatatest_simple_bot You can use NLU ID from another project as long as the project is set as public Threshold can act as a confidence level and these values range from 00 completely uncertain to 10 completely confident This confidence level is usually set between 07 to 08 So the data that falls under 0708 will not be detected by the bot The field only allows numbers

type you used Output Types Functionals Raw Use this output type if your entity type is trait It will result in raw sentences Dictionary Use this output type if your entity type is dictionary It will result in an array consisting of keys and labels Phrase Using supermodel kata entity you must use this output type Path is a feature to support integration with Supermodel Click Create to finish your NLUs For example you must integrate an NLU ID muhfadhiilkatatest_simple_bot which has 1 entity name topic and entity type is trait to an intent named topic The entity topic has 2 labels FAQ order and buy The first step is you will fill in the NLUs form as follows NLU Name topicnl NLU Type NL NLU ID muhfadhiilkatatest_simple_bot Threshold 08 As Intent topic Output RawNext you will define this NLU

      "contents": "Introduction Training Data Generator is a feature that enables you to automatically generate training data up to 100 data using sentence samples or we call it data samples Before creating a data sample you will need to define the keyword and synonyms inside the word bank feature Why is it required We do permutations from data samples and keyword variants to generate the training data Lets try a case You create a word bank from Kenapa which consists of variant words or synonyms from Kenapa For example knp ngap ngaps kenaps So you have 4 word variants Next you create a data sample For example Kenapa ATM saya bermasalah ya We will create a permutation or combination from a data sample with variant words For example expected generated data will be like this knp ATM saya bermasalah ngap ATM saya bermasalah ATM saya bermasalah ngaps kenaps ATM saya bermasalah And many more Also we have a feature that is bulk tagging to tag all generated training data with your available entities and labels It enables faster tagging rather than manually annotating This guidance will elaborate on how to use training data generators and do bulk tagging after generated data shows up Lets get started Create Entity and Labels Before you start you will need to create at least one entity To create an entity go to the NLU gt Models menu Then click the Entity menu Figure 1 Models menu Click Create Entity to set up a new entity It will show a form on the right screen Fill in the entity name Here is the explanation of each field Inherit lets you copy an entity from any public NLU on the Kata Platform To inherit an NLU simply type the NLU ID with usernameproject name Inherited entities will sync to the original entity including the labels and training data For example in the getting started chatbot section your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkatatest_simple_bot Type is intended for the entity type In Kata Platform we have 3 entity types which are Trait is a text classifier that classifies a sentence into particular labels This type is suitable for making your bot recognize nuance in a sentence Dictionary is a word tagger which has keys and labels It will form an array The Phrase is a word tagger Figure 2 Entity type dictionary The Profile is an AI model that is available to use by users You can choose any profiles you want depending on data training and the dataset you have The default profile is suitable for a large number of data samples so that this profile is available in all entity types intent profile is suitable for entity type trait default_v2 profile is our newest profile and is suitable if you have a large amount of data Root enables you to create an entity using other users NLU to copy the training data and add new labels Therefore it is suitable if you have a trained NLU and want to add more labels in the NLU To use this you can type an NLU ID which consists of username and project with format usernameproject name Labels is a feature to determine classes or categories from an entity To add a new label you can type and press enter on your keyboard If you choose entity type dictionary it will show a dropdown name Belongs to This feature enables you to define relationships between entities Belongs to feature can only be used for entities in the same NLU with entity type phrase or dictionary It is suitable if your data sample is like this Saya mau beli es kopi susu 2 dan less sugarEs kopi susu is the main menu 2 and less sugar are modifiers to detailing the order So in Belongs To concept you will tag 2 and choose belongsTo For this guide you will create 1 entity type trait to extract sentences 1 entity type phrase and 1 entity type dictionary to extract words Click the Create Entity button Then fill in as follows for the first entity Name intent Type Trait Label statementHere is the screenshot Figure 3 Create an entity Click the Create Entity button to create the following entity Fill in as follows for the second entity Name object Type phrase Label personHere is the screenshot Figure 4 Create an entity Fill in as follows for the last entity Name things Type dictionary Key car Labels suv van lcgcHere is the screenshot Figure 5 Create an entity Click Create to finalize The next step is to create a word bank when youre done Create a Word Bank In this part you will create synonyms or variants from the keyword Here is the guidance for adding variants You can add 2 words as 1 variant by using space Maximum 20 characters You must create at least 2 variants to create a word bank with a maximum of 20 characters for each variant You can remove a variant by clicking the x button next to the word Step by step to create a word bank Click the Word Bank tab then click the Create button It will show a dialog Fill in the name for your word bank For example you can fill in Kenapa Then create variants by typing a synonym from Kenapa word For example ngaps ngapa kenp knp kenopo Press Enter on your keyboard Figure 6 Create a word bank Finally you have variants Then click the Create button to create a word bank Create a Data Sample Once youve created a word bank now youre ready to make a data sample Data sample is a sample sentence that consists of a word bank and several words as a base to generate training data or called a pattern Here are the steps Go to NLU gt Training

Figure 20 Trained data detail Limitations There are several important notes when using a data generator such as You can create unlimited data samples and word banks but the system only generates up to 100 training data You can create data again if you want to add more than 100 generated training data or sentences It recommended using new data samples when generating new training data to make similar combination training data or sentence results If youre not satisfied with generated training data we recommend these approaches Create a new data sample with a different pattern from previous data samples If you want a specific sentence but the system does not show what you want then we recommend you to use the training feature in NLU gt Training instead If you have another NLU and want to use word banks or data samples from the current project it cannot be done now The bulk labeling feature is only for the Data Generator feature You cannot use it for now independently This is the end of the guidance You can contact supportkataai if you have any difficulties when implementing this ",

      "contents": "Introduction Building a chatbot on Kata Platform is quick and easy even with a lack of programming knowledge In this tutorial we will learn how to create a simple bot on LINE Messenger to order a pizza We will also learn how to train your bot with NL Studio Lets start by looking at this bot diagram or commonly called conversation tree Conversation tree is an overview of chatbot functionalities In this conversation tree we break down the process of ordering pizza and the types of bot action we want to use on each state Sign up to Kata Platform Create an account on Kata Platform to start building chatbot On your browser open and click Sign Up Then fill the form with a username an email and an account type Continue by clicking Sign Up You will get a confirmation email once our team has verified your account You may follow the instructions provided in the confirmation email to activate and start using your account Create a Project Login to Kata Platform On your browser open platformkataailogin and enter your username amp password Click Login to continue Create a project After you logged in you will be taken to the Project Page Click on Create Project and fill in the form Each project contains one bot design one NL and one CMS NLU language is used to determine which language model you want to use Currently we support Bahasa Indonesia and English You can also choose NLU Visibility to be public or private If you choose public all Kata Platform users can utilize your NLU using root and inherit function Create Fallback Flow Create fallback flow Once you create a project you will be redirected to the Bot Studio menu Now we are going to learn how to create a flow Flow is a container of intent state and action A flow typically represents a linear process The first flow that we will create is a Fallback Flow Its purpose is to handle undefined users input or commonly called else condition state In this case the else condition is everything that is not Start Order You may find a flow that is created automatically by the system or default flow We will delete that flow by pressing more button and then Delete Next click Create Flow button to create fallback flow Set flow to active persistent and default Create fallback intent After you have created fallback flow we will create new intent by pressing the Intents tab on the submenu Then we will create a new intent for fallback flow Click Create Intent button to create Then fill in the form as follows Create State init Next we will create a state called init Click the button at the bottom right of your screen Fill state with name init on Overview tab and set it to initial state and end state as shown below Enabling Initial State and End State will make init the first and the last flow to be checked by the bot when there isnt any flow that matches a users input Now we will create a bot response to display an apology message Click Add actions button to create a response Container for creating action will appear Create Action Text in State init Click on button to create a new action Choose action type Text Then fill in the form Click on Create Action button Create Self Transition in State Init The last step to finalize fallback flow is to create selftransition for init state Self transition is required to avoid error when the next state is not available Click on Transitions and enable Self Transition Click Create button Your screen should look like this Create Order Flow Next we will create Start Order flow to handle pizza order Create Flow Order First step is to create another flow called order Created flow will be shown like this Create Keyword NLUs for Order In this step we will define the NLU Natural Language Understanding to trigger order flow NLU is used to translate user inputs into data that machine can understand There are many types of NLU but the type that we will use in this particular flow is called keyword To define the NLU go to NLUs menu Next click on Create NLU Choose Keyword type and enter keywords that represents order such as order pls order order pza Successfully created NLU looks like this Create Intent for Order Each flow requires an intent to classify users inquiry and trigger matching flow So our next step is to set initial intent for order flow Go back to Conversation Flow menu and click on order flow then click on Intents tab Previously you already created keyword NLUs called order We will set that keyword as intent in order flow Map the NLU on classifier section Click Create to create the intent Your screen should look like this Create a State Named init Every flow must have at least one state Because we havent created any state in order flow we have to create one Lets create a state called init Click Create button to create initial state Next we will define how the bot will respond to user who entered order flow Create Action for Pizza Menu As seen on the conversation tree below the first message in order flow is Show Pizza Type Create a State to Show Pizza type in Text Action Type To get started we need to create a state named showPizza on order flow Click on button in Conversation Flow menu Lets begin by creating an action called pizzaOptions This action will inform users in text about our available pizza menu Click on button to create an action and choose Text as action type Fill in Text action type to inform our pizza menu Click on Create Action to finalize Next step is to create an action called askOptions Click on Create Action button Your form should look like this Then you have to make selftransition in Transition tab as follow Click Create to create the state Successfully created state will look like this Update showPizza state Into Show Pizza Menu in Carousel Action Type Previous step is an example to create action to show pizza menu in text Lets try to update the state into Carousel action type To update the state click on showPizza state and an update state form will appear Then remove all actions in the state by clicking x on each action After removing available actions we will create an action called pizzaMenu as Carousel action type Click on Add actions button then click on button to create a new action Choose Carousel action type to continue Enter pizzaMenu as name Fill in the carousel content by clicking Add carousel button then click on Add action button to define the label and type Next click on Add Payload button to enter key and value Fill in first carousel with this data Title Pepperoni Text This is the favorite of Peps Thumbnail Image Url Actions Label Pepperoni Type Postback Payload key type value pizza key pizza value PepperoniFill in second carousel with this data Title Veggie Lovers Text Vegie vegie stay healthy Thumbnail Image Url Actions Label Veggie Lovers Type Postback Payload key type value pizza key pizza value Veggie LoversYour first form should look like this Your second form should look like this Finalize this step by clicking Create Action It should look like this Once the bot displays a carousel containing the type for pizza menu its next step is to ask user to select the pizza Click Add actions button to trigger dropdown list then choose askOptions After you select askOptions action click Create Action button to finalize this step Your form should look like this Click Update to update the state Create Intent to Choose A Pizza Now we have to create an intent called pizzaChosen to handle users input after they have selected a pizza type Click on Intent menu in order flow Click on Create Intent and create intent as follow Successfully created intent looks like this Create Transition between init and showPizza Now we will create a transition between two states that we have created before Click the green dot on init state and a connector line will appear Connect that line to showPizza state If you do it right a Create Transition form will appear Fill in the form with these data and click Create Create reenter intent Next we will add reenter intent so the bot can return to its previous state after triggering fallback state Create the intent in order flow Create Action for Asking Pizza Quantity In this step we will learn how to create Ask quantity state Create pizzaQuantity state In this step we will create pizzaQuantity state to handle order quantity The type of action we will use is in this state is Text Click on button on order flow and fill the form as follows Then you have to make selftransition in Transition tab as follow Result Create NLUs quantity Afterwards we have to handle users input with NLUs Because we only allowed number from 1 to 9 we will create a limitation in regex format Click on Create NLUs and follow this screenshot Successfully created NLU will be shown like this Create Intent quantity After we created the NLU we will add an intent to respond users input In order flow click on Create Intent and fill in the form Successfully created intent will look like this Create Transition between showPizza and pizzaQuantity Now we have to create a transition between showPizzaand pizzaQuantity We will also store payloadpizza value into contextpizza Click on the blue dot on showPizza and drag the line to pizzaQuantity state to create the transition Create Transition form will appear after you have successfully connected the states Created transition will look like this Create Confirmation Action Our next step is creating Ask confirmation state Create YESNO keyword NLUs First we will create a keyword NLU to handle yes and no Click on Create NLUs and fill in as follows Successfully created NLU will look like this Create confirmPizza state Now we will create confirmPizza state to handle order confirmation We will also store chosen pizza amp quantity information in this state Select order flow and click on button to create confirmPizza state Add mapping in onTransit tab Dont forget to add selftransition in a state Click Create Action Your

pizzaQuantity and drag the line to confirmPizza state to create a transition Create Transition form will appear after you successfully connected the states Result will be shown as follows Create intent yesno Previously we already made an NLU containing yes and no keywords We will use that NLU as a classifier on an intent First of all we will create an intent in order flow for the keyword yes Then we will create an intent for keyword no Both intent will appear as follows Create done state In done state we will complete the order by saying thank you and end the conversation We will also set a condition when a user wants to cancel the order So in this state we will create two actions sayThanks and sayCancel Also dont forget to add self transition in the state Result Create a transition from confirmPizza to done Next we will connect confirmPizza state to done state Because done is the last state we will set it as default transition Connect confirmPizza to done by clicking the blue dot and drag the line to connect the states Create Transition form will appear after you have successfully connected the states Final flow Publish Your Bot To save your work click on Publish button
